# Behavior-Analytics-for-a-E-Retailer

Business Understanding

In today’s rapidly evolving digital commerce environment, how can transactional data be leveraged to understand customer behavior and lifecycle trends, and transform these insights into a sustainable competitive advantage for an online wholesale retailer? The objective of this project is to build a comprehensive customer intelligence study that not only describes current business performance but also diagnoses the underlying causes, prescribes actionable strategies, and predicts future outcomes. The company specializes in selling unique, all-occasion giftware to wholesale buyers across different countries. Key strategic questions include:

● What products should be sold to which countries, and during which time periods, to maximize sales?

● How do customer behaviors vary by region, season and product type?

● Which products are often purchased together, how can this support effective bundling strategies?

● How can we better understand and serve different customer segments based on their value contribution?


Finally, the insights generated from analysis can support decision-making in several key areas:

Customer Segmentation and Marketing: We used RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) to identify customer segments such as “Champions” and “At Risk.” This enables the business to run targeted marketing campaigns to retain loyal customers and re-engage inactive ones.

Sales and Product Strategy: Association rule mining (Apriori) uncovers patterns in product combinations that are frequently purchased together. These insights can guide the development of product bundling and cross-selling strategies tailored to specific markets.

Geographical Targeting: Analysis of transaction data by country provides insights about regional purchasing preferences. These insights can guide decisions on which products to promote in which countries and at what times, enabling more effective allocation of sales and marketing resources.

Demand Forecasting: The Holt-Winters method supports forecasting future sales trends by product and region. This aids in planning promotions, managing inventory, and coordinating logistics.

Inventory Optimization: Understanding seasonal demand helps manage inventory more efficiently, reducing storage costs and avoiding product shortages.

Customer Lifecycle Management: Analyzing customer behavior over time reveals changes in engagement levels. This enables timely actions, such as sending personalized offers to maintain relationships.

Strategic Reporting: Interactive Tableau dashboards give stakeholders a clear view of key metrics, customer trends, and business performance, supporting informed and timely decisions.
